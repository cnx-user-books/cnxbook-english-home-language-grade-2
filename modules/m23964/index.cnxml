      <para id="id6659300">Listening Skill : LO 1</para>
      <para id="id4213946">First discuss the map and point out the different features: the island, the beach where Paul and Susan are, the light house, rocky outcrop in the ocean, the island with beaches marked, the oddly shaped trees and rocks, pathways and cave. Draw their attention to the starting point. As you read, let the children trace the “journey” on their maps.</para>
      <para id="id6672500">Paul and Susan live at a seaside town. They are quite used to spending time on the water in a small boat with an outboard motor. Naturally this is removed when not in use. The boats are pulled up onto the beach and overturned so that rainwater will not collect in them. Paul and Susan are usually supervised when handling the boat but would know general safety rules and be able to handle the boat on their own. This is how they managed to rescue Lisa. </para>
      <para id="id2681167">After leaving a message for their parents, Susan and Paul hurried back to the beach. There were two sections to the beachfront. There was the small rocky beach where they had played and found the bottle. Further along there was a small bay and a place where the fishing boats came in. There were also a few boats that belonged to some of the people who came to the beach on weekends. Amongst them was their boat, which they often took out on weekends when their father was home, but they were not supposed to go out on their own. However, today they had to ignore the rules. Together they fetched the motor from the shed and carried it down to the edge of the sand.</para>
      <para id="id7230479"/>
      <para id="id1167219378690">“ This is a sort of emergency, “ said Paul. Together he and Susan pulled the boat down to the edge of the sea and into the water. They fitted the motor. Luckily, the sea was calm and the boat rocked gently on the little waves. </para>
      <para id="id8137337">“Right. Check the map. There’s the lighthouse and there’s that group of rocks. If we go between the two we should soon see this island. It can’t be too far because she can see the lighthouse. .</para>
      <para id="id1815169">Susan stowed their supplies in the locker and Paul started the motor. Soon they were between the lighthouse and the rocks. </para>
      <para id="id1167220782578">“Can you see anything?” he asked. Susan raised her binoculars and looked around. </para>
      <para id="id1167221718894">“No, not a thing! And we can’t go any further unless we see the island, because we don’t know which direction to take! What are we going to do?” she said.</para>
      <para id="id7863026">“Let me have a look.” said Paul </para>
      <para id="id1167221834420">“Fine. Oh, wait…there! There’s something now. Yes, it must be. It’s the island!”</para>
      <para id="id1167218873356">Susan passed the binoculars to Paul. He also struggled to see the island at first but then managed to focus on something that had to be the island. </para>
      <para id="id5873734">“That’s it!” he cried excitedly. “Lisa, here we come!” </para>
      <para id="id1167223242028">After a while, they were much closer and the island appeared bigger. They didn’t need to use the binoculars. They began to make out trees, grass and rocks. </para>
      <para id="id1167218547830">“ We have to look out for a small beach on the side facing the lighthouse. There is also this large odd-shaped rock. She says it looks like the head of a rhino,” said Susan.</para>
      <para id="id1167219407873">Paul headed for the beach and they cruised slowly along examining all the rocks. None of them looked like a rhino. </para>
      <para id="id3706136">“ There must be another beach. It is quite a big island,” said Paul</para>
      <para id="id1167221681629">“ Well, I hope we find something soon. I’m hungry,” said Susan.</para>
      <para id="id3221328">“ Right, we’ll just go around this bend and then I think there’ll probably be another beach. We can stop there and have something to eat.”</para>
      <para id="id1167220781411">“Good idea!” Susan opened the locker and took out their supplies. She also had towels, which they could use as a picnic blanket. Paul steered the boat into the little bay and soon they were pulling it up the beach so that it wouldn’t float away while they had their lunch.</para>
      <para id="id1167220597271">Susan unpacked their sandwiches while Paul looked around. Suddenly he turned to Susan. </para>
      <para id="id3757730">“Where’s the map? Look at that tree! Wasn’t there a huge palm tree bending right over?” </para>
      <para id="id7477218">“Yes,” said Susan. “Here it is. But where’s the rock? Oh look. It only looks like a rhino if you see it from this side. Lisa wouldn’t know that it looks completely different from the sea side.”</para>
      <para id="id1167219280948">“So this is it!” Paul was delighted. “Where do we go from here?”</para>
      <para id="id1167218483579">“Uh … let’s see. There should be a path leading up to a cave.” Susan paused with her finger on the map. She looked around. The bushes grew very close together and there was no pathway to be seen,</para>
      <para id="id1167222988025">“Yes, there it is, or at least I think it is,” said Paul. “I’ll go and see.”</para>
      <para id="id1167220087050">“No!” Lisa almost shouted. “ Don’t leave me here by myself. I’m coming too.”</para>
      <para id="id3589971">They packed up their food and made their way towards the thick bush. Sure enough there was a narrow path leading up a short slope. At the top of the slope they could see a rocky outline.</para>
      <para id="id8291280">“ The cave!” said Paul</para>
      <para id="id1167218309250">“Lisa! Lisa! “ Susan called out. “We’ve come to rescue you!”</para>
      <para id="id6717989">There was no answer. They climbed the slope and peered into the cave. Somebody had been staying there. They could see a blanket folded neatly and someone had swept away the sand to make a smooth place to sleep.</para>
      <para id="id1167222072755">“Maybe she has already been rescued,” said Paul</para>
      <para id="id7224318">“Nooo,” said Susan thoughtfully. “It looks like she is coming back. It’s too neat.</para>
      <para id="id3697901">What’s that noise?”</para>
      <para id="id6985237">Suddenly the children were scared. What could it be? Everyone knew that the island was uninhabited by people, but what kind of animals were there? They huddled close together. Then someone stepped into the cave, gasping in surprise as she saw them.</para>
      <para id="id1167219822950">“Who? What?” </para>
      <para id="id3946446">“Lisa!” exclaimed Susan.</para>
      <para id="id1167222957271">“How…?? You found my message? I can hardly believe it!” Lisa began to cry. She was so relieved to be found.</para>
      <para id="id1167217852595">The children explained how they had found her note and came at once. Lisa told them how she had fallen off her family’s yacht in a storm. Her family was sailing around the world and now she didn’t know where they were or what had become of them. She thought she had been on the island for two days.</para>
      <para id="id6829839">It was dark by now and they decided to sleep in the cave on the island and go back to the mainland the next day. </para>
      <para id="id4238440">“What an adventure!” thought Susan as she snuggled up to her brother. “What will our friends say when we tell them what had happened?” </para>
      <para id="id1167221688329">L.V.</para>
      <para id="id4236337">1. Explain any difficult concepts, e.g. why Lisa could see the shape of a rhino from the cave while they could not see it out at sea. Have one learner stand in front facing the class. Standing behind him you can see only the back of his head, but the other learners can see his face. This would be the same for Lisa and the children.</para>
      <para id="id1167220996115">Discuss any difficult vocabulary. </para>
      <para id="id1167222127262">2. Look at Susan’s last sentence. Discuss what would happen when they take Lisa home. </para>
      <para id="id1167221837207">Then ask the children to consider: Do they think Lisa will find her parents? What could have happened to them? Remind them that they would naturally want to find her.</para>
      <para id="id1167223059555">Stress that their suggestions must be reasonable and realistic.</para>
      <para id="id5607849">Their answers could be evaluated for LO 5, as well as LO 2. </para>
      <para id="id1167219603034">If the answer is completely unrealistic, and doesn’t take any known factors into account, it would be rated 1. </para>
      <para id="id1167221833241">If they take into account that Lisa has only been missing for two days and that her parents could have landed elsewhere and are now looking for her - that would be rated 3. </para>
      <para id="id1167223942814">To be rated 5, they would have to have thought of radio contact and that a generalised search would already be in progress.</para>
      <para id="id6979810">The children must listen to each other’s answers and comment on the likelihood of any of the solutions. </para>
      <list id="id1167217733991" list-type="bulleted">
        <item>Work through the planning of the story with the class. Help the learners to develop a logical sequence of events. Let them read the rough copy to a small group. The group members must listen to see if the learner uses the right tense and person. Then they can copy the story neatly and illustrate.</item>
      </list>
      <para id="id1167223098374">Depending on your time, the stories may be read out aloud to the class or allow learners to swap stories and read each other’s silently.</para>

        <item>Introduce the ‘th’ combination before doing the ‘th’ worksheet</item>
      </list>
      <para id="id1167222095554">Encourage the children to find out about early writing in different civilisations. Let them tell the class what they have found out or make a small poster about their findings. Some children could also copy out examples of hieroglyphics or cuneiform for display purposes.</para>
