        <para id="id1170855602222">The ICS modules for Grade 3 encourage learners to do extensive reading, both fiction and non-fiction. They are given frequent opportunities to write and develop their vocabulary and language use. These developing skills are supported by techniques and strategies to develop phonic awareness. Word recognition and comprehension skills are practised and phonics systematically introduced and consolidated.</para>
        <para id="id1170847453149">The learning outcomes for Grade 3 are purposefully integrated to enable learners to write about texts which they have listened to, discussed and read. </para>
        <para id="id3047006">The topics chosen for the modules are of interest to the Grade 3 learner, within their range of experience and other learning areas, namely, Life Orientation and Mathematics are well integrated.</para>
        <para id="id1170848313109">Learners in Grade 3 use their communication skills more effectively and given the opportunity, these can overcome social, cultural and language boundaries. They become more sensitive to the needs of everyone around them.</para>
        <para id="id2128654">All aspects of language learning as described in the learning outcomes and assessment standards for Grade 3 have been covered in these eight ICS modules. By reinforcing, consolidating and applying these supported by the Critical and Developmental Outcomes, the learners will be able to think and reason in their home language.</para>

        <title>The sly rabbit - Chapter 1</title>
        <para id="id4273348">People usually say foxes are sly but this is a story of a sly rabbit. Read it and see whether you agree with the title.</para>
        <para id="id7579186">There was once a rabbit that lived in the thickest part of a jungle. He had learnt to use his ears and eyes because there were many enemies lurking nearby who thought rabbit pie was really nice. He could run very fast and he had learnt to run in a zigzag pattern to put his enemies off track. He had many narrow escapes and was nearly caught by a fox, a hyena and a hungry wolf. Fortunately he found a rabbit hole nearby and dived underground just in time.</para>

        <para id="id1170847653353">There were, however, some animals he was not afraid of. He knew the elephant was not a meat eater. He liked the green grass and fresh leaves of the trees. So did the giraffe. The hippopotamus was lazy and seemed to spend most of his time in the water or basking in the sun on the sand banks. And so it happened that the rabbit became very friendly with these large creatures of the jungle.</para>
